## Description

Time limit: 4 hours

You are creating an application for managing your robot collection.<br/><br/>
This project is intended to provide you with an easy starting point to demonstrate your skills.<br/>
A bare [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) project is provided as well as a basic [express](https://expressjs.com/) API.<br/>
The project supports hot reloading.

## Setup

### Install dependencies:

`npm install`

### Run:

`npm run start`

App: `localhost:3000`
API `localhost:3001`

## Requirements:

- Your project must include detailed instructions on any necessary setup and it must be runnable.
- Data created by user interactions must be "persisted" in some way by the API such that the front-end app can retrieve it.
- There are no specific design or style requirements for the UI other than it must be functional.

### App

- View all robots
- View details of a single robot
- A way for a user to create a robot
- A way to delete a specific robot
- A way for robots to fight
- A way to view past battle results

### API

  - Name
  - Color
  - Attack
  - Defense

### Extra Credit

A few ideas:<br/>

- Provide a working database solution for the project
